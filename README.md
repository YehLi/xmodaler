# X-modaler
X-modaler is a versatile and high-performance codebase for cross-modal analytics. This codebase unifies comprehensive high-quality modules in state-of-the-art vision-language techniques, which are organized in a standardized and user-friendly fashion.

## Installation
See [installation instructions](https://xmodaler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/installation.html).

### Requiremenets
* Linux or macOS with Python ≥ 3.6
* PyTorch ≥ 1.8 and torchvision that matches the PyTorch installation. Install them together at pytorch.org to make sure of this
* fvcore
* pytorch_transformers
* jsonlines
* pycocotools

## Getting Started 
See [Getting Started with X-modaler](https://xmodaler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started.html)

### Training & Evaluation in Command Line

We provide a script in "train_net.py", that is made to train all the configs provided in X-modaler. You may want to use it as a reference to write your own training script.

To train a model(e.g., UpDown) with "train_net.py", first setup the corresponding datasets following [datasets](using_builtin_datasets.md), then run:
```
# Teacher Force
python train_net.py --num-gpus 4 \
 	--config-file configs/image_caption/updown.yaml

# Reinforcement Learning
python train_net.py --num-gpus 4 \
 	--config-file configs/image_caption/updown_rl.yaml
```
