# Use Custom Datasets

Datasets that have builtin support in X-modaler are listed in [builtin datasets](using_builtin_datasets.md). If you want to use a custom dataset while also reusing X-modaler’s data loaders, you will need to **register** your dataset (i.e., tell X-modaler how to obtain your dataset).

## Register a Dataset

To let X-modaler know how to obtain a dataset named “MyDataset”, users need to implement a class either in the folder `xmodaler/datasets/images` or `xmodaler/datasets/videos` that returns the item in your dataset and then tell X-modaler about this class:
```
from ..build import DATASETS_REGISTRY

__all__ = ["MyDataset"]

@DATASETS_REGISTRY.register()
class MyDataset:
    @configurable
    def __init__(
        self,
        stage: str,
        anno_file: str,
        seq_per_img: int,
        max_feat_num: int,
        max_seq_len: int,
        feats_folder: str
    ):
        # load dataset and set hyperparameters
        ...

    def __call__(self, dataset_dict):
        # process a data item for a specific task
        ...
        return item_dict
```
The function can do arbitrary things and should return the data dict in either of the following formats:
* X-modaler’s standard dataset dict using builtin keys defined in `xmodaler/config/constants.py` will make it work with many other builtin features in X-modaler, so it’s recommended to use it when it’s sufficient.
* Any custom format. You can also return arbitrary dict in your own format by adding extra keys for new tasks. Then you will need to handle them properly downstream as well.
